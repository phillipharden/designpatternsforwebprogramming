<!-- 
Four classes minimum (2 concrete/derived classes, the Abstract/Super class, the class for composition and the Utility Class)

A static property is used.  Make sure you indicate by commenting the top of your HTML file what line of code contains the static property. 

All of your JavaScript is adequately commented. All methods and member variables are explained in comments just above their declarations

Show one level of inheritance 

Composition and/or aggregation is used. The 'owner' object has at least one object. Make sure some property is outputted of the the child object. (The child object is the object that the owner object has instantiated)

A looping process is used to create instances of at least three of your objects

Store all references of the objects in a Data Structure (array / list)

All classes must make sense and serve a purpose to the scenario that you choose

All instantiated classes must have at least 1 instance / member variable(property). Make sure the values for at least one of the instance variables value is unique to each instance such as "name"

After all objects are instantiated, invoke a function named displayInfo() that will display all the objects and their instance variables and a static variable in browser using HTML

The data being used is collected from an HTML form for the JavaScript version. Do not hard code the data.

The output is styled using CSS

Confirmation message each time user adds something to the array. Ex: "Employee added". Do not use the alert function to accomplish this!
